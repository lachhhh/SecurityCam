# SecurityCam
This is a camera script i made in py that uses your webcam and looks around for any humans and if a human is seen within the 5 second time gap it will take a picture and save on the computer of that human that is found

***Infinite bounds within the picture***
If ANYTHING that is resembled as a human is spotted it will take a picture of it.

***Live cam footage***
I have 3 types. EXE Witch is the 1 update every 5 sec or the normal py script like that or the full on live script that takes a bunch of photos every second and saves it all to a specified folder 

press q to close



***Examples***
